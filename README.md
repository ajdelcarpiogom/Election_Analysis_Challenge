# Election_Analysis_Challenge

### Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to calculate the number and percentage of votes not only for each candidate to determine the winner, but we also took a step further to view which county out of the three was the largest county by looking at the voter turnout.

### Election-Audit Results

#### County Results
- The number of votes cast in this congressional election was 
- Number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county:
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855 votes)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055 votes)
  - Aparahoe: 6.7% (24,801 votes)
- The county that had the largest number of votes: Denver.
#### Candidate Results
- Number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each candidate:
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213 votes)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892 votes)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606 votes)
- With this information we were able to clearly see that Diana DeGette won the election with a total number of 272,892 votes, giving her 73.8% of the total votes cast.

### Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for many other elections because this can serve as a foundation for calculating more such as determining the winner for each county or state, as well as analyzing whether there is a correlation between the county and candidate. This script can also be used (and I'm sure in a way has been used) to determine the biggest states or counties during a congressional as well as presidential election and can be analyzed to view the majority of each state's/county's party. Having this information can help parties and candidates address areas where they are least and most popular in order to gain as well as confirm their votes during elections.
